> Talking to someone as you're coding is a timeless problem-solving technique. It is so effective that it even has its own name: the *rubber duck method*... **but what if you don't have someone to talk to?**

`DevDucks` is a VSCode extension gives you a whole fanbase of
people to talk to! Running the extension opens a chat window
on the side of your screen, pouplated with AI chatters that react to your code in real time as you type. It's like you are livestreaming your editor! "w" in the chat.
