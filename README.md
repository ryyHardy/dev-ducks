# dev-ducks README

DevDucks is a VSCode extension that is a Twitch chat-like window populated with Ducks that help you code!

## Features

The extension monitors the typing from the user on the screen and reads the file, and will give feedback in the form of twitch comments that will help improve the user's code in a unique, funny way. Also, the user can directly type into the text box and a response will be given from AI in the form of a twitch chat. The responses from the "viewers" will all be helpful towards coding, and their names will have duck themed usernames to fit the name devducks.

## Known Issues

- The extension needs to be more consistent.
- Better error handling is necessary.
